# Introduction
Toboggan Creek, situated near Smithers, British Columbia, is a glacial tributary to the Bulkley River that flows into the Skeena River. This system sustains a coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) population that has been augmented by a hatchery since 1984. Since its inception, the Toboggan Creek Salmon and Steelhead Enhancement Society (TCSSES) has overseen the hatchery operations and conducted most of the stock assessment activities tied to the program. The Toboggan Creek program is an indicator for North Coast coho populations, providing vital trend information about smolt production, harvest rates, marine survival, and annual escapement.

Coded wire tags (CWT) have been an essential tool for exploitation rate assessment data for Toboggan coho (Middle Skeena Conservation Unit) and has offered the longest-standing full indicator data for northern British Columbia. Since 1988, the full indicator program has been operational and crucial for assessing stock status (DFO NC StAD, 2022). An advantage of using CWTs is the ability to draw information on survival and/or abundance of a specific stock from highly mixed-stock fisheries (PSC NBTC, 2002). These models are particularly strong in predicting marine survival for tagged hatchery smolts. However, whether the survival and exploitation of hatchery and natural origin coho is the same is an assumption that has been recently called under question (Chicatun, 2024).

The Toboggan Creek smolt project, which began in 1995 by DFO and delivered by SKR Consultants, was designed to collect data on the number and age distribution of coho smolts migrating from the creek. In this context, “wild” coho refers to those of natural origin, as hatchery-bred adults are allowed to spawn with wild individuals in the creek. A fyke trap was initially used then trapping evolved to using rotary screw traps (RSTs) in 1998 to reduce stress and mortalities on the salmon. In 1999, CWT tags were used on the wild smolts to better estimate the wild population. In 2000, a wolf type weir (Wolf, 1951) was constructed upstream of the Toboggan Creek hatchery to allow greater catch of coho and upstream passage of steelhead (O. mykiss), and an inclined plane trap (IPT) was installed downstream of the hatchery (SKR Consultants, 2001).

Following a temporary pause, the project resumed by DFO in 2020, operated by the Toboggan Creek Salmon and Steelhead Society. Marked hatchery smolts volitionally out-migrated from the hatchery ponds  and was used as the “marked” component of the mark-recapture program estimating the smolt population size. While the Toboggan program serves as an indicator for wild fish populations, it had only marked hatchery coho, operating under the assumption that hatchery and wild-origin smolts follow similar migration routes and distributions. However, data from 2020 to 2023 suggests that survival rates may differ between wild and hatchery-origin coho, with environmental factors, management practices, and biological characteristics potentially influencing survival outcomes (Chicatun, 2024).

The absence of CWT hatchery fish releases in the spring of 2024, due to a disease outbreak at the hatchery, created challenges for determining exploitation rates for that year class. However, this setback presented a valuable opportunity to focus efforts on a wild-marking initiative. Therefore, DFO Stock Assessment ran a wild smolt trapping program in spring 2024 to bridge the gap of this missing year.   


## Objectives
1.	Estimate the wild smolt population size out-migrating from Toboggan Creek using mark-recapture.
2.	Characterize size and age composition of the wild smolt outmigration from Toboggan Creek.
3.	Apply a large number of marks (adipose clip and coded-wire tag) to assess marine exploitation.


# Methods
*Note: Methods are adapted from the Toboggan Smolt Standard Operating Procedures document. For details, see: Chicatun, V., & Peck, K. (2024). Toboggan Smolt Standard Operating Procedures 2024 – DRAFT V2. Fisheries and Oceans Canada, North Coast Stock Assessment Branch.*

The Toboggan Smolt program required intensive labor, especially during peak migration, high water and debris events. Rotary screw traps were prone to debris accumulation in their live boxes from leaves, logs, and branches, and could lead to high mortality rates among juvenile fish if left unchecked. Therefore, regular checks and working in split shifts were required. The programs ran from Sunday evening to Friday during the start and end of the migration period when fewer smolts were intercepted. During the peak migration, shifts ran from Monday to Sunday. The shifts were split into two per day: a morning shift beginning at 5 AM and ending once all the fish from the two traps were processed, and an evening shift at 8 PM for setting the traps. Traps were set overnight only because this was the time when the majority of the smolts out-migrated. 

During peak migration and high water events, the number of visits were dependent on the conditions of weather, forecast, and timing. Smolt migration timing in 2024 was similar to previous years where work intensity increased after the second week of May and peaked from the end of May to mid-June.

Two sites were selected for the operation of this program.

- Red Barn: Located downstream of the hatchery and approximately 2 km upstream of the adult fence, allowing full mixing of marked and unmarked fish before reaching the second site. A 4-ft diameter RST was installed at this site. 

-	Adults Fence: Located 4.5 km downstream of the hatchery.  A 6-ft diameter RST was installed at this site. 

Rotary screw traps are sampling devices designed to capture downstream migrating juvenile fish. They are large, cylindrical traps that float on pontoons and can be positioned and set overnight to funnel out-migrating smolts into a holding chamber. Continuous rotation was crucial for trapping success, and if debris obstructed this movement, it would cause a full night of trapping to be lost because the fish could swim out of the trap box. Regular trap check-ups included inspections of the cable system, connections, and pulleys to ensure they were in good condition and securely fastened. 

# Procedures:

The primary goal was to minimize fish mortality and protect infrastructure. To meet the minimum target of 7000 CWT-marked smolts, both sites carried out adipose clipping and coded-wire tag  marking with standard 1.1 mm tags with several codes (see appendix X for codes and number of fish they were applied to). Additionally, a caudal clip was applied to smolts at the upstream trap to estimate weekly outmigration, alternating the upper and lower caudal clip each week. Recaptured fish at the downstream trap were inspected for the caudal clip.. Biosampling, including length, weight, and age structure data, was conducted at both sites, with up to 25 smolts measured at each location per day. On most days, at least three crew members were needed for daily operations.

<u>**Morning Shift**</u>
**Environment:** To investigate the relationship between environmental variables and coho smolt outmigration, we examined discharge and temperature data throughout the trapping period. Discharge data was obtained from the Water Survey of Canada’s real-time hydrometric station on Simpson Creek at the Mouth (station 08EE012; Environment Canada 2025), which served as a proxy for Toboggan Creek in the absence of a direct gauge. This substitution was deemed appropriate through DFO staff observation of flow patterns during field visits. Water temperatures and levels were taken by DFO technicians at the start of each site visit for both the Red Barn and Fence sites.

**Overnight Retention Checks:** On Mondays and Tuesdays, up to 50 tagged fish were placed in a holding pen overnight to check for coded wire tag overnight retention. This retention rate was then applied to the entire week, so consistency in terms of tagger, methodology, etc., were maintained for the remainder of the week. An appropriate concentration of tricaine methanesulfonate (TMS or MS222) was used to sedate the fish. A 5-gallon bucket and medium-sized dip nets were used to transport the fish from the RST holding box to the biosampling area. Battery-operated bubblers with diffusion stones were placed in the buckets to provide aeration for the waiting fish. A V-detector (Northwest Marine Technologies) was used to check for CWT tag retention and tallied by tag code. Any fish that did not retain their tags were re-tagged. Any overnight mortalities were checked for along with possible causes for death and tag placement. The fish were then released in a calm location downstream once they recovered from the MS222.

**Biosampling and CWT Tagging Procedure:** The first 25 juvenile coho (excluding young-of-year fry) were measured for fork length to the nearest millimeter, measuring from the tip of the nose to the fork of the tail, and weights to the nearest 0.1 g. Scales were sampled starting at a fork length of 60 mm, with a target of 5-10 fish sampled for in 5 mm intervals. Any exceptionally large or small fish (down to 60 mm) was monitored for scale sampling. Scales were sent to DFO’s Sclerochronology Lab at the end of the season for age determination.

Unexpectedly, a small number of adipose clipped hatchery coho  from previous years were caught and identified by their healed-over adipose-clip, checked for CWT retention, measured and recorded,  and sacrificed to check the tag code. Hatchery fish were taken back to the office, frozen in Ziplock bags, and later dissected for their CWTs. A dissecting microscope was used to read the CWTs and recorded.

All fish >=70 mm were adipose clipped and tagged. Fish <70 mm were kept in a bucket and released. This size cut off was based on historical scale samples determining that coho under <70 mm were young of year At  the Red Barn site, the caudal clip was applied according to the weekly stratification starting on Mondays (Top or Bottom). Fish were sorted based on size and coded wire tagged with the respective head mold size: small fish (70-85 mm): 65/lb head mold, big fish (86-115 mm): 45/lb, and bigger and biggest fish (116-190 mm or >190 mm): 15/lb head mold. Note, only one fish >190 mm was captured and recorded in 2024. In the beginning of the season, a small number of fish were tagged and culled/sacrificed in order to check for correct tag placement. After the first 25 coho, the remaining coho did not have to be weighed and were sorted by eye or using a fish viewer if they were close to the size cut-offs. Every fish tagged was checked for retention using the V-detector and placed in the recovery bucket. Once all the fish were tagged and recovered from the anesthetic, they were released in a calm eddy downstream. 

Any non-target fish were identified and, if time permitted, measured for length and weight.  

<u>**Evening Shift**</u>
Traps were set in the evening at both sites and recorded. Traps were adjusted based on flow, debris accumulation, overnight temperatures, etc. It was important to try and maximize the catch and minimize any possible trap issues overnight.

<u>**Data Analysis**</u>
All data was compiled daily and entered into Microsoft Excel spreadsheets and subsequently analyzed using R  (version 4.4.2) using the packages tidyverse, readr, ggplot2, dplyr, knitr, kableExtra, scales, tidyr, flextable, FSA, magrittr, dplyr, and nnet. Analysis focused on summarizing counts by species, site, size, and mortalities. An age-length key was created by summarizing the relationship between age and length from the subsample of scale-sampled fish, which was then used to estimate age distribution across the full dataset. A correction for growth over the season was applied .

To assess the relationship between weight and length, a log-log linear regression model was applied. This transformation is commonly used because the untransformed relationship is nonlinear: fish typically gain length linearly but accumulate weight volumetrically. Additionally, smaller fish tend to exhibit less variation in weight compared to larger individuals. 

Fulton’s Condition Factor (K) was calculated for wild coho smolts to assess body condition, using the formula:  K = W/L^3 x 100,000, where W is weight in grams and L is fork length in mm.

Environmental variables such as stream discharge and temperature were sourced or plotted to assess trends and identify potential associations with migration activity.

All data manipulation and visualization were conducted using either R or Microsoft Excel.

*Note that these were hatchery fish released in previous years, identified by their healed-over adipose clip scar in the field and confirmed with dissected tag codes.

A  total of 18,615 coho smolts were caught throughout the season, and 20 of these were suspected to be hatchery releases from the previous spring based on their healed-over adipose fins, lack of a secondary mark and length (Table 1). These hatchery fish were sacrificed to retrieve the codes on their CWTs and all but 3 of these fish were aged with scale samples. Of these fish, 12 had coded-wire tags retained and 10 were readable as 2023 hatchery releases from the 2021 brood year. The remainder were aged as 3 year olds or assumed to be hatchery releases from the previous year based on their similar size, healed adipose scar and lack of a secondary mark. The average fork length of the hatchery coho was 122.89 mm (+/- 9.88 SD) and the average weight was 19.74 g (+/- 4.14 SD).

Steelhead or rainbow trout (O. mykiss) were the most prevalent juvenile bycatch and only a small number of other species were observed (Table 1). Adult bycatch were released without counting. 

Occasional periods of very low or very high flows impacted trap efficiency (see Figure 5 for details). A total of 2 missed trap days/nights were lost because of high flows or debris, or about 3.64% of the total trapping days/nights.

The peak for wild coho smolt outmigration occurred between the last week of May and the first two weeks of June (Figure 1). The date with the greatest count of coho (wild) was June 4, 2024, with a total count of 1,681 fish between the two sites. The date with the lowest count of coho (wild) was June 24, 2024, with a total count of 17 fish. There were more coho (wild) caught at the fence site than the barn site with a total count of 12,865  fish and 5,727 fish, respectively.

Each wild coho smolt was separated into size categories so they could be CWT tagged with the correct head mold size. Coho between 86-115 mm were most abundant with a total of 13,588 fish (Figure  2). Coho between 70-85 mm and 116-190 mm had similar counts with a total of 1,161 and 1,145, respectively. Coho between 60-69 mm and >190 mm was least abundant with totals of 206 and 1 fish, respectively.

The bubble plot presented in Figure 3 visually represents the age estimates for all smolts captured after applying the age-length key for wild coho smolts. The plot shows the relationship between the fork length (mm) and the age of the fish using the Gilbert-Rich (GR) age classification system. 

The plot illustrates that most coho smolts in the their second year of life have a fork length that range between 55-110 mm while smolts in their third year of life mostly range between 110-165 mm. Most of the coho smolts in their fourth of year of life ranged between 170-185 mm.

While great care and precaution was taken to ensure as little harm as possible, a relatively small percentage of mortalities did occur, both accidentally and intentionally. Accidental moralities could have occurred through stress from the traps, anesthesia, handling, or a combination of all. Intentional mortalities occurred for two reasons. Firstly, a small sample (0.07%) of wild coho were sacrificed at the beginning of the season to check for correct CWT placement in order to determine the correct head mold size to use for tagging. Secondly, all hatchery coho were culled in order to retrieve their CWTs.

The 24-hour retention rates were generally quite high and the average retention for the two representative days was applied to the rest of the injected fish that week (Table 3). Any shed tags from the subsample were also re-tagged and re-added to the total releases. A total of 15,420 coho were estimated as released to the ocean with a coded-wire tag (Table 3). Size classes were generally kept consistent within the coded-wire tag code, so some anecdotal information about the size of fish in the ocean catches can be drawn from the tag size.

Mark-Recapture

If using a simple Lincoln Petersen estimator with Chapman modifier using the number of wild coho tagged and released at the barn RST upstream (5,559), the total number of wild coho over 70 mm in fork length caught at the fence RST downstream (12,534) and the total recaptured at the fence trap (2,145), we estimate the wild smolt population was 32,476 (500 SE; R package recapr ref) in 2024. The trap efficiency was very high, with 38.5% of the total population caught at the downstream trap alone.  

Figure 5: Comparison of daily mark sequence applied at the barn (the upstream trap) in the bubble plot scaled by number of applied tags. The bar chart shows the daily number of recaptures at the fence site (downstream) with the different caudal clips. “none” meant that the caudal clip was not recognizable, and this was the case for a small number of recaptures throughout the season.

Figure 6 illustrates that pulses in streamflow – often associated with rainfall or glacial melt events – corresponded with increases in coho smolt captures. The data suggests that increased flows may act as a migratory cue for coho smolts . These flow pulses temporarily increase water velocity and access to channel margins—conditions that collectively facilitate safer, more energetically efficient downstream movement. This relationship reinforces the importance of integrating environmental monitoring into smolt trapping programs to better understand migration drivers and inform predictive modeling.  
Fish catches were occasionally impacted by environmental conditions. During periods of very low or very high water, the trap experienced periods of partial or full inoperability due to debris or flow levels. These events led to intermittent gaps or reductions in trap efficiency, especially on May 21, June 18 and 19, which may have resulted in fewer coho caught.

Figure 7. illustrates the water temperatures levels taken during each site visit. The pull points show temperatures taken when the traps were pulled (trap stops running and fish were collected for processing), primarily in the early mornings. The set points show temperatures taken when the traps were set in the evenings (traps start running and collecting fish overnight).

# Conclusion

Following the pause in hatchery smolt releases due to a disease outbreak in 2024, StAD was presented with a unique opportunity to focus on a wild smolt mark-recapture. The intensive field program, particularly during peak migration periods, involved close monitoring and maintenance of RSTs at two primary sites. The 2024 Toboggan Smolt Program generated a population estimate of wild smolts to be just over 30,000, helped characterize the juvenile coho population in terms of size and age, and coded-wire tagged over 15,000 wild smolts, allowing a comprehensive analysis of survival and exploitation rates. Efforts proved that this program delivery is suitable and cost-effective in the future. 

The Toboggan Creek Hatchery released an average of about 32,000 tagged smolts from the spring of 1987 to 2023. While the number of wild released was lower than historic hatchery releases, the likely higher survival of wild smolts make up for that smaller release. 
 
With preliminary analysis showing wild smolt survival to be higher than hatchery smolt survival (Chicatun 2024), the continuation of wild marking will be critical for evaluating assumption that wild and hatchery survival is the same. The information gained on wild coho smolt marking will be invaluable in guiding sustainable fisheries management decisions and supporting the long-term health of North Coast Skeena coho stocks. Information about marine survival should available in fall 2025, when the majority of the smolts released in spring of 2024 should return as spawning adults (PSC Tech. Rep. No. 47).
